                If you are not home when the courier attempts to deliver your
                order they will typically leave a note or calling card. This
                calling card usually contains the details needed to contact the
                courier to arrange a suitable re-delivery date. The courier will
                attempt to deliver your order two times however if for any
                reason you do not contact them and/ or they are unable to
                contact you, the delivery may be returned to us.
